TET - Train Everything 
Keep statistics on every known text.
Verdict: pretty bad

Train Only Errors (TOE) 
- if classifier gets something wrong, train the text as a message of the message it should've been classified into
Verdict: pretty good

Single Sided Thick Threshold Training (SSTTT) 
- same as TOE except with added thing
- even if classifier gets something correct, checks "how" strongly correct the class was. If margin of correctness not high enough, then train anyways

Double Sided Thick Threshold Training (DSTTT)
- same as SSTTT except train "out" of every incorrect class
- good for Winnow

Double Sided Thick Threshold Test and Reinforcement Training (DSTTTR)
- Same as SSTTT, but text gets reclassifeid and improvement measured
- If new classification doesn't meet threshold req, or doesn't improve enough (3 pR units), then text gets trained out of incorrect classes
- Trains using pR values after training and retesting

Train Till Exhaustion (TTE)
- After training new text into classifier, re-classify
- If not, "adequately learned" yet, train again (repeat as necessary)
- Tip: put a loop count maximum

Train Until No Errors (TUNE) 
- repeat testing and training until no more errors are made
- seems like a recipe for overfitting lmao
